### This is an applet that stays on your system tray that helps you disable active netwrok adapters.

No longer you'll have to painfully go to network and sharing center to disable a network adapter, with this tool you can do it from your systemtray

### why
if you ever used 2 ethernet connections in a windows pc and wanted switch between them you had to go to network and sharing center and disable/disconnect the ethernet you didn't want
as this was becoming increasingly painful switching ethernet connections 4-5 times a day, I made this tool

Here is a small demo on how I use it to disable ethernet connection
